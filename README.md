# Django Project
All the basic minimum requirements are reached in both my posts and profiles app.

## The Extra 30%
- More advanced design throughout using Semantic UI (non Django feature) & the interconnectedness of the website as a whole
- New user can register through a form (used allauth Django)
- Used calculated values based on what you found from a query (my main extra feature)
- Can update user's profile information
